Snake Game-

Snake game was one of the first projects I created outside of school, and it was by far one of my favorites. I began the project towards the end of my introduction to C++ class, where I learned the fundamental concepts of the language. Snake has been one of my favorite games to play since I was a kid, so when I learned that it was possible to create the game in C++, I decided to give it a try. This project mainly focused on using a multitude of functions, loops, and case statements, to allow a user to play a game of snake. 

	The program has 4 different functions alongside the main function. The first function is the setup function, which starts the game, sets the snake to the middle of the board, and creates a random fruit location. The next function is the draw function, where multiple for-loops are used to draw the board, the snake head, and the fruit. This function is also where the growing snake tail is drawn as well. The third function is the input function, where the user's inputs are taken in (WASD & X) to move the snake or end the game. The last function is the logic function, which is essentially responsible  for the logic of the game (score addition, snakehead running into itself, border reset, etc.) All of these functions are then run in a while loop in the main function to create a snake game.
